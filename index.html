                    <p>Want to remodel your blue kitchen cabinets but think I would be to costly? Then consider kitchen cabinet refacing. </p>
<p>The cost of kitchen cabinet refacing is considerably less than the expense of completely gutting your kitchen and in a much shorter time period. </p>
<p>Kitchen cabinet refacing can be a terrific option to consider if you need a whole new look to your kitchen without breaking your budget. </p>
<p>Kitchen cabinet refacing usually includes covering the exterior surface of your existing cabinets with a new laminate. </p>
<p>The old doors and drawer fronts are then replaced with new custom-made doors and drawer fronts. The types of cabinet front choices are laminate and solid wood. </p>
<p>Most property owners intend to keep the layout of their kitchen the same particularly if the kitchen is well designed, well built and functional. </p>
<p>So there is absolutely no reason to tear the cabinets out. A new kitchen project can leave your kitchen unusable for a long as six weeks. </p>
<p>Kitchen cabinet refacing can range from simply repainting existing cabinets and drawer fronts and updating hardware to stripping cabinet doors and applying veneer or other decorative elements. </p>
<p>Refacing can also include completely replacing cabinet doors in a new style using new materials. By remodeling a kitchen you should expect to see a return on your initial investment of from 75 to 130 percent. </p>
<p>You should find that based on how old they are the existing cabinets are often of better quality construction than those made by today's standards. </p>
<p>That is especially true or the quality sturdier cabinets you will find in vintage homes. You can save a substantial amount by updating your existing cabinets since they are already installed, leveled, finished, and operational. By going with a kitchen cabinet refacing rather than replacing the cabinetry you will actually be getting all the benefits of a major custom remodeling job at a much more affordable price. </p>
<p>Since new kitchen cabinetry can be expensive, blue kitchen cabinets refacing can be a viable alternative since it can save you anywhere from 33-60% off the expense of putting in new kitchen cabinets. </p>
<p>The cost of kitchen cabinet refacing will be based upon the number of cabinets, the cabinet veneer and the hardware choices (hinges door knobs, etc.). </p>
<p>The average cost of kitchen cabinet refacing can run about $7,500. Some other benefit of kitchen cabinet refacing includes: the work can be done in a very short time (a day or two). </p>
<p>It is a more affordable and faster way of reaching a new fresh look for your kitchen than a complete remodeling job. Provides the kitchen with a whole new and fresh appearance. </p>
<p>It also increases the home's value. Also with new kitchen cabinet hardware added to your kitchen cabinet refacing job will the newly refaced cupboards look like brand new custom built cabinets including better functionality with the intallation of roll-out shelves, better drawer slides and storage. </p>
<p>In most kitchens the cabinetry provides the most noticeable area and therefore greatly influences the style and design of the kitchen. </p>

<p>If the cabinets are dark the kitchen will feel darker. If the cabinets are scuffed and old looking this will make the kitchen look older and outdated. </p>
<p>Kitchen cabinet refacing can do a lot to enhance the look of the kitchen. Since only the outside surface of the cabinets are replaced the work can be done in less time and at considerably less expense. </p>
